To use the app as a waiter, you will need to use one of the waiter access options provided. For example, you can log in with the following credentials:

Username: David
Password: 123

If you wish to log in as a kitchen staff, you can use the following credentials:

Username: Alex
Password: 123
or
Username: Sara
Password: 123

Note: The app has separate access levels for waiters and kitchen staff to prevent them from accessing views not relevant to their role and ensure they can perform their tasks efficiently.
